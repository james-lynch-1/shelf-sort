# 41030 Engineering Capstone project: Shelf-Sort
Identifies book spines in an image and sorts them using [binpackingjs](https://github.com/olragon/binpackingjs).

Creates a mesh for each book in Three.js and uses WebXR and hit testing to place them in the user's real-world surroundings.

Users can sort the books one-by-one or instantly view the completely sorted configuration.

Requires a Chromium-based browser for WebXR features.

Vertical device orientation only.
